# Aqira Rainfall and Flood Prediction

This repository contains code and data for the Aqira Rainfall and Flood Prediction project. The project aims to predict rainfall patterns and identify flood-prone areas using machine learning techniques and geospatial data analysis.

## Overview

Floods pose a significant risk to many regions, and accurate prediction of rainfall patterns can help in early flood warning systems and disaster preparedness. The Aqira Rainfall and Flood Prediction project utilizes historical rainfall data, geospatial information, and machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for rainfall and flood-prone areas.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps to clean and transform the rainfall data, as well as geospatial processing to identify flood-prone areas.
- Machine learning modeling: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model is used to predict rainfall patterns based on historical data. The model is trained and evaluated using the provided dataset.
- Weather data integration: Real-time weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API to enhance the accuracy of rainfall predictions.
- Geospatial visualization: The project includes geospatial visualization using Geopandas and Matplotlib libraries to display flood-prone areas and predicted rainfall patterns.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Aqira Rainfall and Flood Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/aqira-rainfall-flood-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Obtain the rainfall data and flood area shapefile and place them in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the `rainfall_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and generate rainfall predictions.
5. Explore the results and visualizations in the notebook.

## Data Sources

- Rainfall data: The rainfall data used in this project can be obtained from [source].
